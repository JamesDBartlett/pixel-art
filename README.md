## About the Developer
[James D. Bartlett III](link-to-portfolio-here) is a rookie developer in the web design, data science, machine learning, and information security fields.

Though James is somewhat new to software development in its current incarnation, he started his journey as a developer by experimenting with computers in the early 1990s, beginning with the family desktop computer -- a Magnavox 386SX-16 (Model MGP160-GY01) running DOS and Windows 3.1. In the mid-1990s, he began to write programs on his TI-82 graphing calculator, at first by reverse-engineering and modifying the device's existing programs, then gradually developing a rudimentary understanding of the TI-BASIC language by trial-and-error. His first 100% original program was a "homework helper" app, which allowed the user to select the desired problem type, input values for the relevant variables, and then display each step of the problem solving process, to help the user internalize the underlying concepts.

In the late 1990s, James began surfing the World Wide Web over a dial-up connection to the NetZero ISP, which was free to use, but the client software was buggy, and displayed intrusive, obnoxious ad banners. This annoyance served as the impetus for James's first foray into "hacking," wherein he wrote a batch file that would cause the graphical front-end of the client program to crash, while leaving the dial-up process running in the background. Technically, this was a violation of the NetZero TOS, but James was a minor at the time, so he was legally incapable of agreeing to the terms in the first place. ;-)

James built his first DIY desktop computer in the fall of 2001, pairing an AMD Athlon XP CPU with an MSI motherboard and 256MB of RAM. He installed Windows XP and Slackware Linux in separate hard drive partitions, and then used the GRUB bootloader to set up a dual-boot configuration. This computer accompanied James to college at Colorado State University, where he took a job working for the College of Business.

Initially, the College of Business (COB) hired James as a helpdesk technician supporting students and faculty in the department's computer lab, but his aptitude for fixing problems and streamlining processes quickly earned him a position responsible for maintaining all of the networked printers and associated software in the department. Upon observing the sheer volume of paper and toner being used by the students and faculty on a daily basis, James decided to look for ways to reduce the COB's economic and environmental impact. Using HP's Web Jetadmin server software, James implemented several small changes to the default settings of the COB's networked printers. Two of these new default settings -- Duplex (print on both sides of the page) and "Economode" (toner saving) -- were responsible for cutting the COB's IT department expenses by tens of thousands of dollars per year.

Having proved himself both proactive and technologically resourceful in previous roles, James was promoted again, this time to an entirely new position: Security Team Lead. Under his direction, the Security Team tested and deployed cutting-edge intrusion detection systems, traffic analyzers, adaptive firewalls, video surveillance systems, and biometric access control devices. During this period, the Security Team regularly conducted sanctioned penetration tests on the network in order to find and eliminate weaknesses before they could be exploited by malicious software or users.

In 2004, the "Sasser worm" brought the entire university's computer network to its knees, and though the COB's network infrastructure itself was mostly immune to the DDoS aspects of the attack, many individual systems were still infected. Ultimately, the Security Team took most of the heat for not having anticipated and adequately prepared for such an event, and James stepped down as its leader. In the aftermath, a new Security Team lead was chosen, and James transferred into a different department within the COB -- the Distance MBA Program.

In this new role with the Distance MBA Program, James was tasked with taking over the development of an interactive web interface for the half-dozen or so online classes that were currently in development. The existing code was all in Adobe Flash, which had been very popular, but was beginning to show its limitations, particularly vís-a-vís cross-platform compatibility, scalability, security, and standards compliance. After a semester of maintaining and supporting the existing Flash-based interface, James proposed a major shift: Ditch Flash and replicate its functionality using standards-compliant HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The department heads gave him the green light, and over the summer break, James scrapped the Flash codebase and migrated all of the course content over to a brand new interface. Harnessing the cutting edge interactivity features of the Dojo Toolkit, and employing custom code to achieve broad cross-platform compatibility and ADA-compliance, the new interface helped the COB deliver its MBA course content to students all over the world.
